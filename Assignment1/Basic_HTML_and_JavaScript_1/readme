Basic HTML and JavaScript Examples

This folder contains two HTML files along with corresponding JavaScript files that demonstrate basic HTML and JavaScript concepts.
Files:

    Basic_HTML_1.html: This HTML file demonstrates various basic HTML elements and attributes, including:
        <img> tag for displaying an image.
        Text color styling using color names and hex codes.
        Font styling using the <font> tag with different face and size attributes.
        Text formatting using <b>, <i>, and <u> tags for bold, italic, and underline, respectively.

    Basic_HTML_2.html: This HTML file includes a button that triggers a JavaScript function when clicked. It also contains a paragraph element with an ID that is updated dynamically by the JavaScript function to display a message in green text.

JavaScript Files:

    Basic_JavaScript_1.js: This JavaScript file contains a single alert() function call that displays a pop-up alert with the message "Hello, this is a JavaScript alert!".

    Basic_JavaScript_2.js: This JavaScript file defines a function named My_First_Function(). When called, this function assigns the string "Kiss me, I'm Irish!" to a variable, colors it green using the fontcolor() method, and then updates the content of an HTML element with the ID "Irish" to display the colored text.
